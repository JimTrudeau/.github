We recommend that you create an issue before submitting a pull request (PR), to ensure that your proposal is consistent with our direction.

You must review Contributing.md (link below) before submitting. Among other things, that will point you to our licensing requirements so that we can use your code. It also tells you how we handle PRs.

When submitting, point to the issue you opened. In the PR, provide these items at a minimum.

#### Description

#### Related Issue

Point to the issue you opened to start the discussion with us.

#### Context

What do we need to know about your development environment, tools, development target, and so on. Screenshots are always helpful if there is a UI element to this PR.
